## Spring Boot REST example with JPA

This is a example application from [New Circle Training] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbPSjI4tt10) which explains a sample REST application with Spring Boot and JPA.

It's an iterative example which starts from a very single class with minimal REST design to a basic MVC oriented application on REST.
