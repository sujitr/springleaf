## Spring Boot REST example with JPA

This is a example application from [New Circle Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbPSjI4tt10) which explains a sample REST application with Spring Boot and JPA.

It's an iterative example which starts from a very single class with minimal REST design to a basic MVC oriented application on REST.

### Flow of this example
* First, it tries to show the use of RestController
* Second, it shows use of JPA Repository
* Third, it shows use of MvcController with a HTML templating engine - Thymeleaf


### Running the application
Just run the spring boot application main class and hit http://localhost:8080/reservations in browser.
