## Spring REST with Json Web Tokens 

This module will attempt to implement authentication with JWT for a spring REST service.

#### What is difference between JWT and OAuth? (taken from [this link](https://community.apigee.com/questions/21139/jwt-vs-oauth.html#))
The question is an common one, but it isn't quite sensible. JWT is a type of Token, and OAuth is a Framework that describes how to dispense tokens. 
JWT can absolutely be used as an OAuth Bearer token. In fact, this is the most common practice. In light of that "JWT vs OAuth" is a comparison of apples and apple carts.
